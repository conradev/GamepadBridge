# GamepadBridge

GamepadBridge brings the HTML5 Gamepad API to iOS WebKit using the iOS 7 `GameController` framework.

In other words, you can now support iOS game controllers in your HTML5 game. All you need to do is install this Pod and `UIWebView` will magically have support for gamepads.

It is compliant with the W3C's latest [Editor's Draft](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html) of the Gamepad API. 

***Notice:*** This project currently uses **private APIs** to hook into `UIWebView`. I will work on removing them.
